    <h1> Homework 2, by Wang xiahao, Jan 25, 2018 </h1>

    <h2> Executive Summary </h2>

    <p> The purpose of the assignment is to find whether there is an impact on the return of the stock before and after the ex-dividend date. I have gathered all the S&P 500 companies that have given dividends from 2011/01/01 to 2017/12/31 to understand the arithmetic mean return from -20 day to +20 day taking ex-divdate as day 0.

     <h2> Summary of the result</h2>

    <p> <h3>The diagram shows the arithemetic mean of all S&P500 across 7 year after 2010 </h3>

    <h2> Implementation And Methdology</h2>
    <p> <b>Detailed Implementation in R is available on my github <a href="https://github.com/paragonhao/corporateFinance/blob/master/HW2/hw2.R">here</a> </b></p>
  
    <div> Assumptions: Use Return on stock without dividend so that the fall in return after ex-div date can be clearly observed.</div>
    <ul>
      <li>Step 1: Download data from CRSP, data is available from my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/9pvyhu86mp45fik/sp500_stock_data.csv?dl=0">Dropbox</a>
      </li>
      <li>Step 2: Identify the ex-div dates: ex-div dates are the dates in the rows where column Payment Date is not NA.</li>
      <li>Step 3: Slice the data into vectors of 41 days. Add all the vectors together to get the arithmetic mean of the 41 days. Subtract the daily return of S&P500 to get the excess return. </li>
      <li>NOTE: There is a small chunk of data that are NAs from the excess return calculation. I assume 0s for the NA data.
      This would be a fair assumption since the dataset is large, hence replacing NAs with 0 would not impact the mean significantly.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="notice">TAs, please do not judge me too harshly.</p>
