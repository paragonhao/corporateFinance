      <p>
     One obvious observation that we can make is that majority of the firms in SP500 are profitable, as there are hardly a few firms whose EPS are below zero. Also, majority of the firms sits in the first quadrant of the graph, indicating steady growth in earnings while maintaining positive EPS over the years. 
    </p> 

    <h3>Fun facts about the data</h3>
    <p> As it is commonly known that growth firms may experience negative EPS as their are putting in capitals to capture the market, most of the high growth firms does not appear to have very bad financial status as based on their EPS. This is probably because the firms in SP500 are well-established and financially sound. However, the firm with strong growth but worst EPS is FTR( Frontier Communications Corp). Their stock went from $100 to $2 till now. One way to interpret this is that the high expansion strategy strapped the firm with high debt, causing to fall from grace later on. </p>
    
    <p> The firm with the highest growth in earning and strong EPS is CHTR (chartered Communication). Their stock picked up from $165 in 2016 to $328 in 2017. This might be a good example of the market being quite efficient in this case. 
    Among the high growth stocks at that time are AMAT, FB, NFLX, NVDA, if we picked those stocks which grows at a fast pace, yet maintained a healthy financial status, we might be able to receive very good returns on these investment.</p>
    
    <p>And it is no surpise to see firms with very negative growth make zero or negative earnings on the third quadrant of the chart</p>
