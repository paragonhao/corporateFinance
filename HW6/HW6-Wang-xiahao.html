    <h1> Homework 6, by Wang xiahao, Feb 23rd, 2019 </h1>

    <h2> Executive Summary </h2>

    <p> The purpose of the assignment is to compare the lagged change in percent earnings and E/P (earnings per share / price). For this purpose, EPS(Earnings per share diluated excluding extraordinary items), price of the stock at end of fiscal year, EBIT (earnings before interest and tax) from Compustat are included for data analysis. Data from inancial reporting year 2015 to 2017 for s&p500 are used for this assignment.

     <h2> Summary of the result</h2>
     <p>Following diagram show the SP500 E/P vs Change in Earnings </p>

      <p>
     One obvious observation that we can make is that E/P for majority of the firms in SP500 are slightly above zero, regardless of the change in earning for the company
     Accorinding to the Internet: The earnings-price ratio is a way to help determine a security's stock valuation, that is, the fair value of a stock in a perfect market. It is also a measure of expected, but not realized, growth. It may be used in place of the price-earnings ratio if, say, there are no earnings (as one cannot divide by zero). It is also called the earnings yield or the earnings capitalization ratio.
     In this case, one interpretation is that the firms in SP500 are well-established and financially sound, hence most of them would make positive EPS hence giving a positive on the chart. If the entire stock market is plotted on the graph, I would have imaged that the graph will be littered with dots that are below zero.
    </p> 

    <p> A further investigation proved my guess and shows more firms falling below the zero mark.</p>
